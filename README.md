# Voronoi Diagrams on the GPU

This repo contains demos for my blog post. If you want a library that uses jump-flooding for distance-field generation, see [this repo](https://github.com/ryankaplan/gpu-distance-field) instead.

I wrote a blog post on how it works over [here](http://rykap.com/graphics/skew/2016/02/25/voronoi-diagrams/). Or you can skip right to the [paper that it's based on](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tants/jfa.html).
